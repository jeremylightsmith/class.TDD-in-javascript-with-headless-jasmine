# TDD in Javascript with Headless Jasmine

This project is a represents some starting and ending points for TDDing a very simple HTML file using Jasmine.

## Versions are :

In ruby:

* **ruby-nojs** - html w/o javascript
* **ruby-badjs** - javascript the way it might have been written naively & without tests
* **ruby-testedjs** - the finished product

Here we're using jazz money, the short on that is :

    var jasmine = JsBdd;
    var traceMonkey = Mozilla.JsEngine;
    var johnson = Ruby + TraceMonkey;
    var envJs = JsBrowser;
    var harmony = johnson + envJs;
    var jazzMoney = jasmine + harmony;

----

In C# :

* **csharp** - a csharp version that uses V8 with Noesis + env.js to do it

----

Not a lot of docs, but hopefully there will be a follow on screencast kata that moves from ruby-nojs to ruby-testedjs.
